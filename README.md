## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
<hr>

Millions of user use social network for surfing, visiting countless websites and clicking on countless ads/recommendations  on these website.
Knowing what the users are interested in and what the users are using in real world would be of great significance for future recommendations used by marketing team to attract potential users
as well as ad placements and real time bidding
Predicting the likelihood of users clicking on a particular content
Ranking the recommendations in each group by decreasing predicted likelihood of being clicked

We have made Kaggle submission ofrandom forest model. The model is evaluated as shown in the image below

#### Observations
* Maximum percentage of clicks were made through mobile phones, followed by desktop and then tablets. Mainly because: 

* App Availability: the app is available that is available on desktop is now present on model too.

* Convenience:  Games or social networking apps frequently serve as a way to pass the time while on the subway commuting home or in a cab or surfing net. This directly reflects the increase in uses of mobile devices

#### Observations
* We observed that the click frequency is very high between 10-15 hrs. Around 10-11 a.m. time people are usually on their commute to work, school etc. and pass their time surfing net. Around 1-3 p.m. is usually lunch time where people get time to surf internet and thatâ€™s the frequency is high.

* The frequency in the bucket 15-20 is again when people are traveling back home and around dinner time when they have time to surf internet.
